OpenMDAO component wrapper for DREA (Differential Reduced Ejector/Mixer Analysis).
The DREA code calculates performance and flow characteristics for mixer-ejector
nozzle designs.  Note, this wrapper uses geometry and flow variable trees to ease
passing of information to HSRNoise.
 
This installation does not include the DREA source ore executable. You must obtain
that separately through the proper channels.
